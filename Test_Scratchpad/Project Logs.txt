Started drafting up card prefabs
	-Played with anchoring and TMP
	-Added Debug Logging, preferably 4-line debugging

	-Debug Information added
	-played with anchoring

Created a scriptable object that acts as a card database
	-Added 3 types of cards to it

Decision: Create blank cards and set them up in 1 batch, or create and setup cards all inline?


Creating a Card:
	Give the card an index to send to the database used by the menu
	Using a static reference to the currentMenu, reference the db and get the values to set to the card
	

	Generating a random string of characters:

	Created a C# event that is linked to the menu by the menu when it creates the card.
